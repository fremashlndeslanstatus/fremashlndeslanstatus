freedom cash lenders loan application

Apple Pay Later divides your purchase into four equal installments, each due two weeks apart, with the first payment due immediately.

For example, if you want to make a $500 purchase with Apple Pay Later, you’ll pay $125 at checkout. The next three installments — each $125 — are due every two weeks.

This pay-in-four loan structure is common with BNPL. But Apple Pay Later sets itself apart in its combination of zero interest and no fees, which is hard to find among other BNPL providers. Klarna, Afterpay and Zip all charge fees for late payments.
