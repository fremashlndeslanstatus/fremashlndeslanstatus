Today Apple introduced its hotly anticipated new payment feature, Apple Pay Later.

The feature lets users split an eligible purchase into four equal installments with zero interest over the course of six weeks when they check out online or in-app through Apple Pay. Apple Pay Later, which is essentially a loan, is currently available to select consumers and will be released to all eligible users in the coming months.

Apple Pay Later was first announced during the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2022, but it faced delays in the fall. Its official release marks the tech giant’s entry into the lucrative "buy now, pay later" industry, which has skyrocketed since the start of the pandemic.

“There’s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to how people manage their finances,” said Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet, in a company press release. “Many people are looking for flexible payment options, which is why we’re excited to provide our users with Apple Pay Later."
