Users can apply for Apple Pay Later in the Apple Wallet. Available loan amounts range from $50 to $1,000.

Though Apple hasnâ€™t disclosed a minimum credit score requirement, it will conduct a soft credit check as part of the application, which won't affect your score.

BNPL applications tend to be short, and providers may rely less on credit scores to qualify applicants compared to traditional credit. The cost of the purchase, the funds available on the card used at checkout and any history with the company are often considered.

Once approved, users can check out with Apple Pay Later and view upcoming payments in the Wallet app. Payments must be tied to a debit card, which will be billed automatically on the payment due dates, though Apple says it will send reminders.
